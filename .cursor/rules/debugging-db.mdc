# Database Debugging

A lightweight SQL query tool exists at `backend/scripts/dbq.py`. Use it for ad-hoc database inspection:

```bash
python3 backend/scripts/dbq.py "SELECT id, role, created_at FROM chat_messages WHERE conversation_id = '...' ORDER BY created_at"
```

- Reads `DATABASE_URL` from the project root `.env`
- Outputs JSON with proper UUID/datetime serialisation
- Works for both SELECT and DML statements
- Run from the `backend/` directory or project root
