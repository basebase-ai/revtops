Lonestar Assembly Solutions - Process Optimization Suite,2025-01-15T09:00:00Z,"DEAL STRATEGY: Champion is Ray Delgado (VP Ops). COO approved budget. Key pain: 12% throughput loss from changeover inefficiency across 3 assembly lines. $200K deal for full Process Optimization Suite. Competing against in-house solution (Excel + manual scheduling). Our edge: real-time ML-based scheduling. Target close: end of Q1."
Lonestar Assembly Solutions - Process Optimization Suite,2025-02-19T12:00:00Z,"PILOT WIN: 2-week pilot on Line 2 showed 9.1% throughput improvement. COO is fully bought in. Moving to contract negotiation. Procurement will handle from here — Ray says they're fast. Forecast: Commit."
Lonestar Assembly Solutions - Process Optimization Suite,2025-03-19T09:00:00Z,"CONTRACT STATUS: Two items resolved in yesterday's negotiation. Contract is with their legal for final signature. Ray expects signed by end of this week. Implementation team on standby. This deal is done — just waiting on ink."
Cascade Automation Systems - Quality Management System,2025-02-04T09:00:00Z,"QUALIFICATION NOTES: Cascade Automation is a mid-size manufacturer (~$50M revenue) making automation components. FDA-regulated facility. Had an audit finding in Q4 2024 — paper-based QMS is their biggest vulnerability. Champion: Beth Sorensen (Plant Director), has full buying authority. Budget: $200K. MUST be live before August FDA re-audit. Urgency is real."
Cascade Automation Systems - Quality Management System,2025-04-09T12:00:00Z,"CEO MEETING DEBRIEF: CEO Alan Park is on board. He cares about risk — the FDA finding was embarrassing. Beth has a green light to proceed. Only remaining item: Beth wants to negotiate payment terms (prefers quarterly vs. annual upfront). IT Director Kevin Tran already signed off on hybrid architecture. Strong deal — forecast as Commit."
Cascade Automation Systems - Quality Management System,2025-06-03T17:00:00Z,"IMPLEMENTATION KICKOFF: 9-week plan locked in. Beth wants to move fast — August 1 go-live is non-negotiable. Our implementation team is confirmed and available starting June 16. Expect signature within 2 weeks once Beth finalizes payment terms. High confidence."
Summit Plastics Corp - Maintenance Contract,2025-03-06T10:00:00Z,"DEAL STRATEGY: Summit Plastics is a 24/7 injection molding shop. Massive pain: 2 unplanned shutdowns last quarter at $180K each. Champion: Marcus Webb (Ops Director). This is our largest maintenance opportunity at $250K. Marcus reports to CEO directly. No competition mentioned — they found us through a trade show. Key: show ROI clearly to CFO."
Summit Plastics Corp - Maintenance Contract,2025-05-01T12:00:00Z,"EXECUTIVE APPROVAL: CEO and CFO approved spend yesterday. CFO negotiated 18-month initial term (we proposed 3 years) with renewal option. Fine by us — once the sensors are in and showing value, renewal is automatic. Marcus is working with legal on MSA. Target close: end of June. Forecast: Commit."
Summit Plastics Corp - Maintenance Contract,2025-05-29T10:00:00Z,"CLOSE PLAN: MSA redlines received — nothing surprising. Our legal reviewing over weekend, clean version back Monday. Marcus says CEO wants July 1 implementation kickoff. Need to pre-order Engel-specific sensor mounts (4-week lead time) — will order at risk once MSA is finalized. Largest deal in pipeline, highest confidence."
Frontier Hydraulics - Maintenance Contract,2025-03-20T09:00:00Z,"QUALIFICATION: Frontier Hydraulics has 40+ hydraulic presses across 2 facilities. Calendar-based maintenance = lots of waste + still getting surprise failures. Champion: Dave Kowalski (Maintenance Mgr). Budget: $50K for initial pilot phase. Good land-and-expand opportunity — full deployment could be $150K+. Dave needs to validate with a pilot before he can get plant manager approval for full rollout."
Frontier Hydraulics - Maintenance Contract,2025-04-29T12:00:00Z,"TECHNICAL VALIDATION: Dave's team is satisfied with sensor capabilities on their specific press models (Schuler + Beckwood). Pilot proposal sent for 10 presses. Next step: Dave takes pilot results to plant manager for full rollout approval. Timeline: pilot in Q3, expand in Q4 if successful."
Blue Ridge Packaging - Automation Integration,2025-04-08T09:00:00Z,"QUALIFICATION: Blue Ridge Packaging adding new packaging line in August. Need automation integration with existing SCADA system. Champion: Lisa Huang (Plant Manager). She's evaluating 2-3 vendors. $75K initial scope — expanded from $50K after Lisa added palletizing integration. Timeline is tight — they need us committed by June to hit August install date. Competitive situation: us vs. local integrator."
Pinnacle Composites - Safety Compliance Upgrade,2025-05-06T10:00:00Z,"QUALIFICATION: OSHA citation last month is driving urgency. Sandra Mills (EHS Director) has $200K budget earmarked. Composites fabrication = serious hazards (resin fumes, dust, fire risk). They need gas detection, ventilation monitoring, PPE tracking. Next OSHA inspection expected Q4 2025. Sandra has buying authority — this could move fast if demo goes well."
TrueForm Tool & Die - Equipment Upgrade Package,2025-03-26T09:00:00Z,"DEAL NOTES: Small shop, owner-operator Frank Mercer is the decision maker. 12 CNC machines, upgrading 4 (2 Haas VF-2, 2 Mazak QTN). Budget: $35K. Simple deal, no committee. Frank wants phased approach: 2 machines now, 2 in July. He's been thinking about this for a while — just needed the right quote. Low risk, high probability."
TrueForm Tool & Die - Equipment Upgrade Package,2025-05-16T09:00:00Z,"CLOSING: Frank is ready. Sending PO and lease app today. First install crew scheduled for week of June 2. This is a clean, simple close. Good candidate for a testimonial/reference — Frank is very hands-on and loves talking shop."
Northern Alloys Corp - Process Optimization Suite,2025-04-15T09:00:00Z,"EARLY STAGE: Northern Alloys is a specialty metals shop. 8% scrap rate on expensive alloy work. Process Engineer Amy Chen is our contact but she's not the decision maker — needs Plant Manager sign-off. $25K budget is small but could expand if pilot works. Need to get in front of the Plant Manager. Risk: small deal could stall if Plant Mgr doesn't prioritize."
Prairie Wind Energy Components - Safety Compliance Upgrade,2025-03-11T09:00:00Z,"CLOSE IMMINENT: Simple safety monitoring deal. Jim Harlan (Safety Coordinator) already has approval. 3 bays, standard safety package at $25K. Contract sent — just waiting for Jim to get signature from his director. Should close any day. Low-touch deal."
Midwest Coatings & Finishes - Quality Management System,2025-04-22T09:00:00Z,"NEW DEAL: Initial outreach to Midwest Coatings. They're a specialty coatings applicator, likely need QMS for automotive tier-1 certification (IATF 16949). No contact established yet — left a message with their quality director. Need to follow up next week. Potential $100K+ deal if they're going for certification."
