DRAFT

We're excited to launch Revtops! This is where we'll share insights, updates, and best practices for revenue operations teams.

## What to Expect

Our blog will cover a variety of topics including:

- **Product Updates**: Learn about new features and improvements to the Revtops platform
- **Revenue Operations Best Practices**: Tips and strategies for optimizing your revenue workflows
- **Integration Guides**: Deep dives into how to get the most out of your data integrations
- **Case Studies**: Real-world examples of how teams are using Revtops to drive results

## Built with Markdown

This blog is built using a simple markdown-based system that allows us to:

1. Write content in plain markdown files
2. Automatically generate an index via GitHub Actions
3. Render posts client-side using your React components

This means all blog posts inherit the styling and design from the main application, creating a seamless experience.

### Code Examples

You can include code snippets with syntax highlighting:

```javascript
// Example: Fetching blog posts
const { data: posts } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['blog-index'],
  queryFn: fetchBlogIndex,
});
```

### Rich Content

You can also include:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- [Links to external resources](https://example.com)
- Images
- Tables
- And more!

## Stay Tuned

We'll be publishing regular content here, so check back often or subscribe to our newsletter to get notified of new posts.
