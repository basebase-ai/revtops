I analyzed their recent Zoom transcripts and found:\n\n- Sarah & David ask an average of **18 discovery questions** per call, heavily focused on pain points and decision criteria\n- Marcus, Jessica, Amy average only **7 questions** per call, spending more time on product walk-throughs\n\nWould you like me to pull specific call examples?"

Multi-threading Workshop (Marcus, Jessica, Amy - 3 hours)\n**Why:** Single-threading is the #1 predictor of deal slippage in your team\n\n**What to cover:**\n- How to identify and map buying committees\n- Email templates for requesting intro to other stakeholders\n- Role-playing executive outreach\n\n**Expected impact:** Could save 4 of the 7 at-risk deals if executed this week\n\n---\n\n### 2. Discovery Question Framework (Jessica, Amy - 2 hours)\n**Why:** Low question count correlating with 22% vs 75% conversion rates\n\n**What to cover:**\n- Show Zoom transcript comparison (Sarah vs Jessica)\n- Practice MEDDPICC qualification\n- Talk ratio awareness and active listening\n\n**Expected impact:** Improve Discovery→Demo conversion by 15-20 percentage points\n\n---\n\n### 3. 1:1 Deal Reviews (Marcus - 1 hour)\n**Why:** Activity gaps and lack of urgency on high-value deals\n\n**What to cover:**\n- Review DataTech situation specifically\n- Build breakup email strategy for dark prospects\n- Set expectation for minimum weekly activity per deal >$50K\n\n**Expected impact:** Prevent future ghosting scenarios, improve forecast accuracy"
